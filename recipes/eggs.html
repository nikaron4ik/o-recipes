    <h2>Steps of cooking:</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <strong>To make the Hollandaise: Whisk egg yolks, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of water, Worcestershire sauce, and white pepper in the top of a double boiler over simmering water.</strong><br>
            <strong>Add melted butter, 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time, while whisking yolks constantly. If Hollandaise begins to get too thick, add a teaspoon or two of hot water.</strong> <br>
            <strong>Continue whisking until all of the butter is incorporated. Whisk in salt, then remove from heat. Place a lid on the pan to keep sauce warm.</strong>

        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>To poach the eggs: Fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, pour in vinegar, and keep water at a gentle simmer.</strong> <br>
            <strong>Crack an egg into a small bowl then gently slip egg into simmering water, holding the bowl just above the surface of water. Repeat with the remaining eggs.</strong> <br>
            <strong>Cook eggs until whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.</strong> <br>
            <strong>Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon, dab on a kitchen towel to remove excess water, and place onto a warm plate.</strong>

        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Brown bacon in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.</strong>

        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Toast English muffins on a baking sheet under the preheated broiler.</strong>
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            <strong>To serve eggs Benedict: Spread toasted muffins with softened butter and top each one with a slice of bacon, followed by one poached egg. </strong><br>
            <strong>Place 2 muffins on each plate and drizzle with Hollandaise sauce. Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve immediately.</strong>
